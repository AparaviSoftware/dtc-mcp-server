1. Introduction 

1.1 Purpose 

The purpose of this SDD is to provide a detailed description of the design of the Road Trip Advisor web application. This document will serve as a guide for the development team and will be used to ensure that the application meets the requirements specified in the Requirements Document. 

1.2 Scope 

This document covers the design of the Road Trip Advisor web application, including the user interface, system architecture, database design, and testing strategy. The application will allow users to plan road trips, find optimal routes, and discover points of interest along their journey.

2. System Overview 

The Road Trip Advisor is a web-based application designed to help users plan and manage road trips. The system integrates with mapping services to provide route optimization, location services, and points of interest discovery. Users can create profiles, save trips, and access their travel history. 

The application consists of several key components: 
- User authentication and profile management 
- Trip planning and route optimization 
- Location services and mapping integration 
- Database for storing user data and trip information 

3. System Components 

3.1 Decomposition Description 

The system is decomposed into the following major components: 

1. Session Manager - Handles user authentication and session management 
2. User Profile Manager - Manages user registration, login, and profile data 
3. Database Manager - Handles all database operations and data persistence 
4. Optimized Path Finder - Core algorithm for route optimization and trip planning 
5. Location Services - Integration with external mapping APIs and geolocation services 

3.2 Dependency Description 

The components have the following dependencies: 
- User Profile Manager depends on Database Manager for data storage 
- Session Manager depends on User Profile Manager for authentication 
- Optimized Path Finder depends on Location Services for mapping data 
- All components depend on the web framework for HTTP handling 

3.3 Interface Description 

3.3.1 User Interface 
The user interface is web-based and responsive, designed to work on desktop and mobile devices. Key interface elements include: 
- Login/Registration forms 
- Trip planning interface with map integration 
- User dashboard for managing saved trips 
- Settings and profile management pages 

3.3.2 Hardware Interface 
The application runs on standard web browsers and requires: 
- Internet connection for map services 
- GPS capability for location services (optional) 
- Standard input devices (keyboard, mouse, touch) 

3.3.3 Software Interface 
External software interfaces include: 
- Google Maps API for mapping and routing services 
- Web browser for client-side execution 
- Database system for data storage 

3.3.4 Communication Interface 
The application communicates via: 
- HTTPS for secure web communication 
- REST API calls to external mapping services 
- Database connections for data persistence 

4. Detailed Design 

4.1 Module Detailed Design 

4.1.1 Mark Current Location 

This module handles the detection and marking of the user's current location on the map. It uses browser geolocation APIs and integrates with Google Maps for display.

Sequence Diagrams 

The sequence for marking current location:
1. User requests current location
2. Browser requests geolocation permission
3. Browser gets GPS coordinates
4. Application calls Google Maps API
5. Map displays current location marker

Pseudocode 
Browser shows default location on google maps 
      Request default location information with google's api 
      Google returns default location 
Uses browser to get current location 
Request current location information from google api 
Google's API returns current locations info 
Browsers renders current location 

4.2 Data Detailed Design 

The application uses a relational database to store:
- User profiles and authentication data
- Trip information and saved routes
- Points of interest and location data
- User preferences and settings

The system also includes location card components that display meal options and other points of interest. When a user selects a meal option, it displays the selected meal option. Every time the user clicks on one of the meal options, it will be displayed on the card component.

Figure 4 - Location Card component shows the visual representation of how meal options are presented to users in the interface.
